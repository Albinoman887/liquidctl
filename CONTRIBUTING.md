# Contributing to liquidctl

Thank you for your interest in contributing to liquidctl!  There are many ways
to contribute and we appreciate all of them.

## Reporting bugs and other issues

Reporting problems with the software is an easy and very valuable way to
contribute to the project.  Please go to [issues](issues) and follow the
appropriate template.

## Contributing changes to code and/or documentation

Awesome!

We generally use [pull requests](pulls) to review and (assuming everything goes
well) merge contributions.

It is not necessary to discuss a change beforehand on an issue, but that can
sometimes be helpful.  You can also reach out to us and other fellow
contributors on [Discord](https://discord.gg/GyCBjQhqCd).

Additionally, the following documents will give you a general idea of our
development process and coding styling:

- [Development process](docs/developer/process.md)
- [Style guide](docs/developer/style-guide.md)

Depending on what you are doing, some of these other documents may also be
useful:

- [Capturing USB Traffic](docs/developer/capturing-usb-traffic.md)
- [Techniques for analyzing USB protocols](docs/developer/techniques-for-analyzing-usb-protocols.md)
- [Porting drivers from OpenCorsairLink](docs/developer/porting-drivers-from-opencorsairlink.md) (introduces the liquidctl driver model)
- other documents in [`docs/developer`](docs/developer)
